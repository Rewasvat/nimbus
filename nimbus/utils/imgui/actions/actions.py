# TODO: ver se dá pra fazer um decorator que ao ser posto numa function, cria uma action que:
#   - recebe os mesmos params da func como inputs da action
#      - principalmente, ver se isso funcionaria com métodos de classes, onde o `self` seria um input a receber tb.
#   - tem os mesmos outputs como os return values da func
#       - se for output tuple[a,b], separa em outputs diferentes
#   - no execute, a action pega os inputs e passa e executa a func, seta os returns como outputs e vai embora.
#   - isso daria problema com save/load. Pro pickle funcionar, a classe precisa existir na raiz de algum módulo.
#       - ai essas coisas que criam classes dinamicamente (dentro de uma função por exemplo) caga o pickle
#       - pesquisar, talvez dê pra adaptar o save/load do pickle pra funcionar com classes dinamicas assim.
